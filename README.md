## Car Logo Detection
This project is focused on detecting car logos in images using deep learning techniques. 
It aims to identify various 8 car logos (Toyota,Mazda,Mercedes,opel,Audi,Lexus,Volkswagen,hyundai) accurately and efficiently, leveraging deep learning models for image classification and object detection.
The code the model is develop using Tensorflow one project (SavedModel.pb) and Yolov8 other project(best1.pt) and then converted to tensorflow lite(best_float16.tflite and best_float32.tflite)

**Features**
Logo Identification: Detects and identifies different car logos in images.
High Accuracy: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models to ensure high detection accuracy.
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing images in real-time for practical applications.
Scalability: Easily extendable to include more car logos as needed
Anyone can customize the bettter accuracy.
